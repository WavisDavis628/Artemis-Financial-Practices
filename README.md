# Artemis Financial Software Security Assessment
## Client Overview and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial is a company that handles financial transactions and customer data, so security is a big deal for them. They wanted to make sure their software wasn’t vulnerable to attacks that could expose sensitive information. My job was to review their system, find security flaws, and fix them to protect their data and keep everything running safely.

## Identified Issues and Security Assessment
During the security check, I found some major risks like weak encryption, possible SQL injection points, and bad input validation. These issues could let hackers steal or change important data, which is obviously a big problem for a financial company.

To fix this, I added SHA-256 hashing, which makes sure that data can’t be changed without being detected. I also made sure all communication between users and the server used HTTPS so that data stays encrypted and safe from attackers. On top of that, I secured API access and improved how user permissions work to prevent unauthorized access.

## Finding Vulnerabilities and Why Security Matters
I used a mix of automated tools and manual testing to find security issues. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite helped me catch common web security problems, while static code analysis tools flagged risky coding patterns. I also went through the code manually to catch any logic errors that automated scans might have missed.

Good security is important because it keeps customer data safe, prevents fraud, and helps companies follow industry rules. If a financial company has a data breach, they can lose customers, face legal trouble, and damage their reputation. Fixing security issues early saves a lot of money and stress down the road.

## Challenges and Insights from the Security Check
One of the hardest parts was deciding which vulnerabilities to fix first. Some were serious and needed to be patched immediately, while others weren’t as risky. I also had to be careful when working with older software dependencies—fixing security issues without breaking existing features was a challenge.

## How I Made the System More Secure and Future Plans
I improved security in a few key ways. SHA-256 hashing protects data from being altered, HTTPS encrypts communication between users and the server, and input validation helps block common attacks like SQL injection and XSS. I also added role-based access control (RBAC), which limits what different users can do based on their permissions.

For future security checks, I’d use regular automated scans, penetration testing, and security monitoring tools to stay ahead of new threats. Security isn’t something you fix once and forget—it needs to be updated regularly.

## Making Sure Everything Still Worked
After updating the security, I ran a bunch of tests to make sure I didn’t break anything. Unit tests and integration tests checked that the security fixes worked, while regression tests made sure existing features were still functional. Instead of showing detailed error messages (which could give hackers useful info), I set up secure logging to keep track of errors without exposing sensitive data.

I also scanned the software for outdated third-party libraries. Some security warnings came from old dependencies, but none of the new fixes introduced any extra vulnerabilities. This confirmed that everything was secure and still worked as expected.

## Tools and Best Practices I Used
I relied on several key tools and coding practices throughout this project. The OWASP Top 10 helped me focus on the most common security risks. I used SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite for security testing. Spring Security helped me tighten authentication and access control. Following best practices like input validation, proper error handling, and least privilege access helped keep the code secure.

## How This Project Shows My Skills
Employers like to see real examples of how you’ve applied security best practices in a project. This project proves that I can identify security risks, implement solutions, and keep software safe. I documented my findings, fixes, and tests, so I can show potential employers exactly how I improved security for Artemis Financial. It’s a solid example of my ability to build and maintain secure software.
